I used ChatGPT to help me understand more the concepts and idea of the classes that I was creating, making sure that my syntax and logic was correct.
The ChatGPT was used in the learning mode, avoiding the code done and engaging with me (even though makes me sad when it made me do  all the repetition in my CircePlayer subclass i.e. LOL)

Due to the CloudFlare instability and the conversation limit of the AI, I also use a lot of documentation, other related projects and forums.
